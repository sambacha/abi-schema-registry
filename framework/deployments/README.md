## Why?

**Should I commit the build directory?**

If you ever worked with Truffle, I bet you asked yourself this question at least
once.

There are different currents of thought between developers but there are a few
unavoidable side effects in committing the _build_ directory:

- the `updatedAt` field is updated every time a contract is compiled
- some user-specific `absolute paths` are stored inside every artifact and may
  cause problems when multiple persons are working on the same codebase
- `git diffs` become much more difficult and messy to read

But Truffle artifacts also contain the addresses of deployed contracts for each
network and these are crucial in order for migrations to work properly.

The solution is to store the addresses in _separate files_ and commit them
instead of the _build_ directory.

Later on, another developer working on the same codebase could just clone the
repo, compile the contracts and merge the deployment addresses back into the
_artifacts_, thus restoring a clean and working state for Truffle.

## Installation

```
npm install --save-dev abi-deployments
```

## Usage

1. **Export**: deployments are read from Truffle artifacts and stored into
   separate network-specific JSON files.
2. **Import**: previously exported deployments are merged back into Truffle
   artifacts.

The most common usage is through Command Line Interface but a Programmable API
is available as well.

## Command Line Interface

### Export deployments

The export command will scan the `artifactsDir` and collect info about the
deployments that were made on different networks for each contract. Then it will
store the deployments in JSON files inside the `networksDir`, one for each
network.

<br>

```
truffle-deployments export [artifactsDir] [networksDir]
```

<br>

| Option                    | Description                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `--network <network>, -n` | specify network/s to export (e.g. 1 or 1,4) |
| `--reset, -r`             | delete old exported deployments             |

\
If not specified, `artifactsDir` defaults to `build/contracts` and `networksDir`
defaults to `networks`.

If a network file already exists, by default Truffle Deployments will append new
deployments without deleting the old ones with the exception of conflicting
contracts that will be overwritten. To delete the old deployments consider using
the `--reset` option.

Consider this initial state:

```jsonc
// build/contracts/Token.json

{
  "contractName": "Token",
  "abi": [],
  "bytecode": "0x60806040523480156200001157600080fd5b50604"
  "networks": {
    "1": {
      "events": {},
      "links": {},
      "address": "0xefE1e4e13F9ED8399eE8e258b3a1717b7D15f054",
      "transactionHash": "0x35db37ae85e2d4af8fb6fc83f1e6edf5ade8700cf75e19dc3f1a0307768948c7"
    },
    "4": {
      "events": {},
      "links": {},
      "address": "0xb56c770c2fa5222947a9e3c5beb8dc46dd656b5f",
      "transactionHash": "0xe31509629b75866917ab387751a75b737b973622d9765af69b557bde038e1210"
    }
  }
}
```

Running the `export` command will generate the following network files inside
the `networksDir`:

```
networks/
  1.json
  4.json
```

Each network file contains all exported deployments:

```jsonc
// networks/1.json

[
  {
    "contract": "Token",
    "address": "0xefE1e4e13F9ED8399eE8e258b3a1717b7D15f054",
    "transactionHash": "0x35db37ae85e2d4af8fb6fc83f1e6edf5ade8700cf75e19dc3f1a0307768948c7"
  }
]
```

```jsonc
// networks/4.json

[
  {
    "contract": "Token",
    "address": "0xb56c770c2fa5222947a9e3c5beb8dc46dd656b5f",
    "transactionHash": "0xe31509629b75866917ab387751a75b737b973622d9765af69b557bde038e1210"
  }
]
```

### Import deployments

The import command will scan all the exported deployments inside the
`networksDir` and merge them into respective contract artifact in the
`artifactsDir`.

<br>

```
truffle-deployments import [networksDir] [artifactsDir]
```

<br>

| Option                    | Description                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `--network <network>, -n` | specify network/s to import (e.g. 1 or 1,4) |

\
If not specified, `artifactsDir` defaults to `build/contracts` and `networksDir`
defaults to `networks`.

Consider this initial state:

```jsonc
// networks/4.json

[
  {
    "contract": "Token",
    "address": "0xb56c770c2fa5222947a9e3c5beb8dc46dd656b5f",
    "transactionHash": "0xe31509629b75866917ab387751a75b737b973622d9765af69b557bde038e1210"
  }
]
```

```jsonc
// build/contracts/Token.json

{
  "contractName": "Token",
  "abi": [],
  "bytecode": "0x60806040523480156200001157600080fd5b50604"
  "networks": {
    "1": {
      "events": {},
      "links": {},
      "address": "0xefE1e4e13F9ED8399eE8e258b3a1717b7D15f054",
      "transactionHash": "0x35db37ae85e2d4af8fb6fc83f1e6edf5ade8700cf75e19dc3f1a0307768948c7"
    }
  }
}
```

Running the `import` command will update `build/contracts/Token.json` like this:

```jsonc
// build/contracts/Token.json

{
  "contractName": "Token",
  "abi": [],
  "bytecode": "0x60806040523480156200001157600080fd5b50604"
  "networks": {
    "1": {
      "events": {},
      "links": {},
      "address": "0xefE1e4e13F9ED8399eE8e258b3a1717b7D15f054",
      "transactionHash": "0x35db37ae85e2d4af8fb6fc83f1e6edf5ade8700cf75e19dc3f1a0307768948c7"
    },
    "4": {
      "events": {},
      "links": {},
      "address": "0xb56c770c2fa5222947a9e3c5beb8dc46dd656b5f",
      "transactionHash": "0xe31509629b75866917ab387751a75b737b973622d9765af69b557bde038e1210"
    }
  }
}
```

## Programmable API

Beside the Command Line Interface, Truffle Deployments can also be used
programmatically.

### Export deployments

```javascript
const truffleDeployments = require('truffle-deployments');

const artifactsDir = 'build/contracts';
const networksDir = 'networks';
const options = { networks: [4], reset: true };

truffleDeployments.export(artifactsDir, networksDir, options);
```

### Import deployments

```javascript
const truffleDeployments = require('truffle-deployments');

const artifactsDir = 'build/contracts';
const networksDir = 'networks';
const options = { networks: [4] };

truffleDeployments.import(networksDir, artifactsDir, options);
```
